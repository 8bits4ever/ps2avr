This repository is an updated version of the Procyon AVRlib set of files.
The original is at http://www.procyonengineering.com/embedded/avr/avrlib/ 
but it was last updated on October 29, 2006.

The files of the original version would not compile. They use out dated
syntax and register names. They also use inb() and outb() which is syntax
that has been deprecated. The files in this 2014 version have been updated
so they will compile using the 4.7.2 version of avr-gcc.
