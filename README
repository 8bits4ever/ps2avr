PS/2 implementation on Atmega32 micro.Circuit schematic available

Original source: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ps2avr/

avrlib libraries have been updated to be able to compile the binary.
https://github.com/kcozens/avrlib-2014

Navigate to "Source" folder and issue MAKE command to compile. You might need to install gcc compiler and other dev tools in your system

Use the already compiled "keymain.hex" if you want to avoid compiling your own binary.
